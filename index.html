                 <p id="spacep"><b>We embrace and expect ambiguity and iteration.</b> To develop transformative learning experiences that simultaneously build capacity while also generating a user-friendly product is not a clear cut process. We balance creativity and analysis and use an iterative learning-by-doing process (Cravens, et.al, 2014)with clients to support innovation.</p>

                 <pid="spacep"><b>We focus on the intersection of emotional intelligence and equity.</b> Developing adults’ emotional intelligence with an equity lens “has the potential to help mitigate the interrelated legacies of racial and class oppression in the U.S. and globally” (Jagers, Rivas-Drake & Borowski, 2018). We work to build adults’ social and emotional competencies as a way to ensure educational equity for youth.</p>

                <p>Shahriur did an amazing job on my product packaging. I didn't have the greatest experience with another fiverr designer, so I asked Shahriur to re-do the designs and I couldn't be any happier with the finished result. He's quick to respond and went above and beyond with his services. Overall a great experience and I highly recommend him over other designers here. Thank you so much and I will definitely return again for future package designs. </p>
